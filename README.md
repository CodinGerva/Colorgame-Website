web application for my city's municipality, utilizing a Node.js server and PUG for templating. The application integrated various APIs and databases to manage user registrations and process
payments. Additionally, it was designed for real-time use during events, enabling on-site registrations and in-person
payments. The system also facilitated the association of users with physical bracelets equipped with QR codes, which
were used to track and assign points to participants.
